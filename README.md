# Dockerized Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This sample application is forked from the one developed and maintained by Michael Hartl for his self-paced learning program [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).  We dockerized it, so we may use it throughout our [quick start guide on Docker](https://github.com/br/dockerized_hartl/wiki/Bleacher-Report's-Docker-Quick-Start-Guide).
